Ford GoBike System in 2018

Dataset:
The data consist of approximately 1,85M bike rides from FY2018. The attributes include the trip start/end time, start/end station.


Summary of Findings:
In the exploration, I found that there are two types of clients using the system: subscribers who are mainly daily commuters, having short
 trips to and from work, who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm, and, occasionally around the lunch time, and customers, usually
 tourists or occassional riders who use the system mainly on weekends to explore the Bay Area. The bike share system was used more often
 around summertime (May-October) with a clear drop from January to March, most probably due to the weather condition. Moreover, I have checked
 if there are some differences in trends for genders. In most cases the trend for males/females was the same, except of the fact that females
 tend to have slightly longer trips and suprisingly, for casual users there are quite a lot of females using the system between January and March
 in comparison to males (the ratio is much smaller than for the rest of the year).
